# 6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## 6.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

Microsoft Excel implements a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to workbooks and features across various platforms.

### 6.1.1 Authentication Methods

| Method | Description | Applicable Platforms |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Microsoft Account | Personal Microsoft accounts for consumer users | All platforms |
| Azure Active Directory | Enterprise authentication for organizational accounts | All platforms |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Additional security layer using a second factor (e.g., mobile app, SMS) | All platforms |
| Single Sign-On (SSO) | Integration with organizational identity providers using SAML 2.0 | Desktop, Web |
| Biometric Authentication | Fingerprint or facial recognition for quick access | Mobile, Windows Hello |

### 6.1.2 Authorization Model

Excel uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for managing user permissions within workbooks and organizational resources.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B{Authentication}
    B -->|Success| C[Authorization]
    B -->|Failure| D[Access Denied]
    C --> E{Role Assignment}
    E -->|Owner| F[Full Control]
    E -->|Editor| G[Read/Write Access]
    E -->|Viewer| H[Read-Only Access]
    E -->|Commenter| I[Read + Comment Access]
```

### 6.1.3 Permission Levels

| Permission Level | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Owner | Full control over the workbook, including sharing and deleting |
| Editor | Can read, write, and modify workbook content |
| Viewer | Can only view the workbook content |
| Commenter | Can view and add comments, but cannot modify content |

## 6.2 DATA SECURITY

Excel implements multiple layers of data security to protect sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

### 6.2.1 Data Encryption

| State | Encryption Method |
|-------|-------------------|
| Data at Rest | AES-256 encryption for stored workbooks |
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.3 for all network communications |
| Data in Use | Secure memory management and encryption for sensitive data in RAM |

### 6.2.2 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Integration with Microsoft 365 DLP policies to prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive data
- Content scanning and classification based on predefined patterns (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers)
- Automated alerts and blocking of potential data leaks

### 6.2.3 Information Rights Management (IRM)

- Workbook-level encryption and access controls
- Ability to set expiration dates on shared workbooks
- Prevention of unauthorized copying, printing, or screenshots of sensitive data

### 6.2.4 Data Residency and Compliance

- Support for data residency requirements in specific geographic regions
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other relevant data protection regulations
- Regular security audits and certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II)

## 6.3 SECURITY PROTOCOLS

Excel adheres to industry-standard security protocols and best practices to maintain system security.

### 6.3.1 Network Security

```mermaid

    A[Client] -->|TLS 1.3| B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Web Application Firewall]
    C --> D[Application Servers]
    D --> E[Database Servers]
    F[Monitoring & Logging] --> D
    F --> E
```
