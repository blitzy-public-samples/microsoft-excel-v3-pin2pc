# Microsoft Excel API

This directory contains the API implementation for Microsoft Excel, providing RESTful endpoints for interacting with Excel workbooks, worksheets, cells, formulas, and charts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- TypeScript (v4 or later)
- Azure SQL Database (for cloud storage)
- Azure Cosmos DB (for NoSQL data)
- Azure Blob Storage (for large file storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/microsoft-excel.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the API directory:
   ```
   cd src/api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values for database connections, Azure services, and other configurations

5. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Documentation

The Excel API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing workbooks, worksheets, cells, formulas, and charts. Detailed API documentation is generated using Swagger and can be found in the `docs` directory.

To view the API documentation:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` in your browser

Key endpoints include:

- `/workbooks`: CRUD operations for workbooks
- `/worksheets`: Manage worksheets within workbooks
- `/cells`: Read and update cell values
- `/formulas`: Process and evaluate formulas
- `/charts`: Create and modify charts

For authentication, the API uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) for enterprise users and Microsoft Accounts for consumer users. Include the authentication token in the `Authorization` header for all requests.

## Architecture

The Excel API is built using the following technologies and patterns:

- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: Express.js
- Database: Azure SQL Database (primary), Azure Cosmos DB (for specific use cases)
- File Storage: Azure Blob Storage
- Authentication: Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Account
- API Documentation: Swagger / OpenAPI

The API follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Services: Implement business logic and data processing
- Models: Define data structures and database schemas
- Middleware: Handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication and error handling
- Routes: Define API endpoints and map them to controllers

Integration with the Excel calculation engine is achieved through a dedicated service that interfaces with the core C++ libraries.

## Security Considerations

The Excel API implements several security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access:

1. Authentication: Azure AD and Microsoft Account integration
2. Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for granular permissions
3. Data Encryption: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
4. Input Validation: Strict validation of all input data to prevent injection attacks
5. Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage of the API
6. Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all API actions for security analysis
7. Regular Security Audits: Automated and manual security testing

## Testing

The API includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and correctness. To run the tests:

```
npm run test
```

This will run both unit tests and integration tests. The testing framework used is Jest, with supertest for API endpoint testing.

For manual testing and exploration, you can use the Swagger UI available at the `/api-docs` endpoint when running the development server.

## Deployment

The Excel API can be deployed to various environments using the following steps:

1. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Set up environment variables for the target environment

3. For Azure App Service deployment:
   - Use the Azure CLI or Azure Portal to deploy the built application
   - Ensure all necessary environment variables are configured in the App Service settings

4. For containerized deployment:
   - Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile
   - Push the image to your container registry
   - Deploy using Kubernetes or Azure Container Instances

Always follow security best practices when deploying to production, such as using secure secrets management and enabling all necessary Azure security features.
