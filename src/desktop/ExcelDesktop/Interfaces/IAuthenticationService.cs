This code defines the `IAuthenticationService` interface based on the provided JSON specification. Here are some key points about the implementation:

1. The interface is placed in the `ExcelDesktop.Interfaces` namespace, which is appropriate for the file location.

2. All methods are defined as asynchronous, returning `Task` or `Task<T>` as specified in the JSON.

3. The `GetCurrentUserAsync` method returns `Task<IUser>`. I've added a basic `IUser` interface to represent the user object, as it wasn't provided in the specification. You may need to adjust this interface based on your actual user model.

4. XML comments are added to provide documentation for the interface and its methods.

5. The interface includes all the methods specified in the JSON: `AuthenticateAsync`, `AuthenticateWithMicrosoftAccountAsync`, `AuthenticateWithAzureADAsync`, `LogoutAsync`, `GetCurrentUserAsync`, and `IsAuthenticatedAsync`.

6. The parameters for the `AuthenticateAsync` method are included as specified: `string username` and `string password`.

7. The `using` statements for `System` and `System.Threading.Tasks` are included at the top of the file.

Here's a list of the pending human tasks as comments within the file:

```csharp
// TODO: Implement the concrete class that realizes this interface
// TODO: Integrate with Microsoft Account and Azure AD authentication libraries
// TODO: Implement secure token storage and management
// TODO: Set up proper error handling and logging for authentication failures
