This implementation of the ICalculationEngine interface includes all the methods specified in the JSON representation. Here are some additional notes about the implementation:

1. We've added the necessary using statements for the ExcelDesktop.Models namespace, assuming that Cell, Formula, and Worksheet classes will be defined there.

2. The interface is marked as public to allow implementation across the application.

3. XML comments have been added to provide documentation for the interface and its methods.

4. The Calculate method returns an object to allow for different types of calculation results (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.).

5. The UpdateDependencies and RecalculateWorksheet methods are void as they don't need to return a value.

6. The RegisterCustomFunction method takes a string for the function name and a Func<object[], object> for the function itself, allowing for flexible custom function definitions.

7. The Worksheet type is used in the RecalculateWorksheet method, assuming it will be defined in the Models namespace.

Lastly, here are the human tasks listed in the JSON specification, added as comments at the end of the file:

```csharp
// Human Tasks:
// TODO: Determine if any additional methods are required for the ICalculationEngine interface (Optional)
// TODO: Review the interface to ensure it covers all necessary aspects of the calculation engine (Required)
